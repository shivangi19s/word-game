A word game built with Python! Inspired by the popular word-guessing game - **WORDLE**, this implementation allows users to guess a 5-letter word within six attempts using interactive color-coded feedback.

- **Word Selection:** Uses a dataset of common words to select a random 5-letter word.

- **Interactive CLI:** Get immediate feedback on each guess with color-coded hints:

  - ðŸŸ©: Correct letter in the correct position.

  - ðŸŸ¨: Correct letter in the wrong position.

  - â¬›: Incorrect letter.

- **Valid Word Checking:** Ensures only real words are guessed.

- **Limited Attempts:** Players have 6 tries to guess the word correctly.
